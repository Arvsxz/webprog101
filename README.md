Material Design Lite (MDL) lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your
static content websites. It doesn't rely on any JavaScript frameworks or
libraries. Optimized for cross-device use, gracefully degrades in older
browsers, and offers an experience that is accessible from the get-go.

> ### Limited support



> No further development is taking place in MDL by the core team, but we are happy to review PRs, fix critical bugs and
> push out new releases. No breaking changes will be accepted.

## Use MDL on your site?

**This document is targeted at developers that will contribute to or compile
MDL. If you are looking to use MDL on your website or web app please head to

to our CSS-only experience.
